                    <p>I am a software test engineer located in New York City with experience tester. 
                    I am a graduate of Brooklyn University where I majored in Biology. Currently, I am working as a software test engineer at Gcom Soft.
                    I am experienced in a variety of programming languages and tools. I love learning new things and solving 
                    complex problems. One day, I hope to use my skills to help people in need and make an impact in the world.
                     When Iâ€™m not working, I like to read, play with my younger sister, go out, and try out new food.</p>
